To connect as a new user on the graphical session, one needs to enter the following command:

	su - <username>

To allow this new user connect to ssh, the administrator has to modify the sshd_config file located in /etc/ssh/.

Once the the new username has been added, the ssh service will have to be reloaded using the following command :

	systemctl reload ssh

After these steps, the new user has to make sure his public key located in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys are only writable by him. 
If it is not the case, the new user will not have the permission to log to ssh.

Finally, the new user can now connect to ssh.
