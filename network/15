We are missing the super user rights to modify the /etc/hosts file.
As of now it looks like this:

127.0.0.1		localhost
255.255.255.255	broadcasthost
::1				localhost

we have to add the new address to this in order to obtain that:
127.0.0.1		localhost
255.255.255.255	broadcasthost
::1				localhost
46.19.122.85	intra.42.fr
