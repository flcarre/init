With information in the whois I know the domain registrar is Online.net SAS, but if look the DNS I can see AWSDNS (Amazon Web Services DNS), anyway the DNS Manager can be anything we can't be sure that the DNS is hosted in the same company as servers so, if I check domain name from ping command I got 54.230.187.104 as server IP and if I check the IP owner I got "AWS" as ISP so now I have no doubts, AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the host of slash16.org.
